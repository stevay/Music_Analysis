# Music EDA Passion Project

Purpose of this project is to look at the Billboard Hot 100 songs from 1950-2018 and see how music has evolved over the last 65+ years. 

We will be using a dataset curated and shared by Kevin Schaich (github page available)

We will also use the Spotify API to get audio features (TBD on what we are using features for)

we will also built a Flask app that allows the end-user to:
- Look up Billboard Hot 100 singles (any song between 1950 to 2018)
- Based on searched song, recommend four other popular songs based on song lyrics
